## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document that contains Project 1 of the BIOMI6300 course.

This project uses a simulated dataset based on an investigation of whether Vitamin B-12 improves a person’s cognitive ability. The simulation was based on summarized results from a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 7 general practices in South East England, UK. A total of 201 participants enrolled, which were divided into vitamin B-12 supplementation (referred to as the b12 group here) and placebo. Cognitive performance was measured after 30 days of supplementation by a verbal learning test.

In this R markdown file, I did:
1. Summarization of dataset
2. Plotting of datasets including bar graphs of number of observations per groups, as well as boxplots and histograms to compare the distributions of the two groups
3. T-test of dataset to determine significant difference in verbal learning tests between the two groups at a 95% confidence interval

## Installing Packages

```{r}
# readxl package, to read excel files
# install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
# dplyr package, to organize and summarize tables
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# ggplot2 package, to create 
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```


## Load Vitamin B12 Study Dataset and Summarize it

```{r}
# Load the table
b12_study_dataset <- read_excel("vit_b12_study_dataset.xlsx")

# Look at the first few rows
head(b12_study_dataset)

# Summarize the table
summary(b12_study_dataset)

# Count the observations in each group
# Save counts into a new table called group_counts
group_counts <- b12_study_dataset %>% 
  count(group, sort=TRUE)

# Group by experimental group and summarize mean, median, range
b12_study_dataset %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(test_result),
            median = median(test_result),
            range = max(test_result)-min(test_result))

```


## Creating Plots from My Data

```{r}
# Creating a figure with the number of participants per group
figure_1_counts <- ggplot(group_counts, aes(x=group, y=n)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  # labels
  labs(y="Number of Participants (n)",
       x="Experiment Group",
       title="Number of Participants per Group")
figure_1_counts
ggsave("figure_1_counts.jpeg")


# Creating a boxplot to compare the median and ranges of the two groups
figure_2_boxplot <- ggplot(b12_study_dataset, aes(x=group, y=test_result, fill=group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  # dots on top of boxplot
  geom_jitter(size=0.4, alpha=0.9)+
  # labels
  labs(y="Verbal Learning Test (n)",
       x="Experiment Group",
       title="Boxplot of Verbal Learning Test Results for B-12 and Placebo")
figure_2_boxplot
ggsave("figure_2_boxplot.jpeg")


# Creating a histogram to compare the distributions of the two groups
figure_3_histogram <- ggplot(data=b12_study_dataset, aes(x=test_result, color=group, fill=group)) +
  # add histogram with density as y axis
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), alpha=0.5, position="identity") +
  # add a smooth density plot
  geom_density(alpha=0.6) +
  # labels
  labs(y="Density",
       x="Verbal Learning Test (n)",
       title="Histogram of Verbal Learning Test Results for B-12 and Placebo") +
  theme_light()
figure_3_histogram
ggsave("figure_3_histogram.jpeg")
```


## Doing a statistical test
Conduct a t-test to test whether there is significance difference between the verbal learning tests between the B12 and placebo groups.
```{r}
t.test(test_result ~ group, data = b12_study_dataset,
 alternative="greater",
 conf.level=0.95)
```
As p-value>0.05, there does not seem to be a significance difference between the two.


## Adding a session info

```{r}
# if(!require('devtools')) {
#   install.packages('devtools')
#   library('devtools')
# }
# devtools:session_info()
# use utils:: as devtools:: didn't work
utils::sessionInfo()
```
