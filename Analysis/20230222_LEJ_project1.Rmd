## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document that contains Project 1 of the BIOMI6300 course.

This project uses a simulated dataset based on an investigation of whether Vitamin B-12 improves a person’s cognitive ability. The simulation was based on summarized results from a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 7 general practices in South East England, UK. A total of 201 participants enrolled, which were divided into vitamin B-12 supplementation (referred to as the b12 group here) and placebo. Cognitive performance was measured after 30 days of supplementation by a verbal learning test.

In this R markdown file, I did:
1. Summarization of dataset
2. Plotting of datasets including bar graphs of number of observations per groups, as well as boxplots and histograms to compare the distributions of the two groups
3. T-test of dataset to determine significant difference in verbal learning tests between the two groups at a 95% confidence interval
